    <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>
        We speak for all women when we say- There are multiple instances in a woman's life where she is exposed to uncomfortable circumstances. Whether that situation be a disrespectful comment or violence against a woman, a woman has seen it all.
        <br><br>
        Even as students, we learn to be accustomed to "jokes" about molestation and hearing laughter during conversations about real sexual assault cases. It has become "natural" for our society to correlate of our gender to rape. From taking pride in making a woman feel uncomfortable to the whispered "what was she wearing?" comments, this direct mockery of real day issues can be seen everywhere in our lives. These comments are made by people as young as high school freshmen. This constant disregard is paralysing for a woman.
        <br><br>
        Women need a space to share their thoughts to the world and shift this internally misogynistic mindset. So, pick up the pen, voice your opinions, rewrite the story, change the narrative because consent in not a debate.
        <br><br>
        Recently, whilst in a social science tuition class, we were learning Nazism. The holocaust was a miserable time for humanity. Women, too, were hurt in this wreckage. For the "crime" of not birthing an Aryan child, a woman's head was shaven off and her face was blackened. Upon seeing the photo of such a tortured woman, the teacher laughed, he simply laughed at her. The first question that arose was simple: How could this still be happening? The thing is that we do not live in Nazi Germany, we live in a democratic country that provides thorough and heavily detailed legislature, so why? Why does our injustice get laughed at? Why does our society choose to be regressive when it comes to our women?
        <br><br>
        The first step to justice is for us, women, to recognize our dignity. We created this website to provide exactly you that, so that if a day comes, that your story is shared, not a single soul could laugh at you, because once the gavel finally falls it won't silence the woman, it would silence the world that laughed at her pain.
