2.	The Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956
The Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 was enacted to prevent and control the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women and girls. It implements the 1950 International Convention signed at New York and came into force on 1 May 1958. The Act extends to the whole of India.

Protection and Rehabilitation Measures:
•	Courts can release first-time offenders on probation or admonition, depending on circumstances.
•	Women or girls convicted of prostitution-related offences may be detained in protective homes for 2–5 years instead of imprisonment, where they receive moral, educational, and vocational support.
Rescue and Custody (Sections 15–17):
•	Police and magistrates have powers to rescue women and girls from brothels or places of exploitation, even without a warrant in urgent situations.
•	Rescued women are to be produced before a magistrate and placed in safe custody or protective homes, ensuring their protection from further exploitation.
•	The Act prohibits keeping rescued women in custody run by persons of a different religion to ensure comfort and trust.
Protective Homes (Section 21):
•	The State Government may establish or license protective homes for the care, training, and rehabilitation of women and girls.
•	Only licensed authorities can maintain such homes. Unlicensed operation leads to a fine up to ₹1000 (first offence) and imprisonment up to one year (subsequent offence).
•	Wherever possible, management of these homes must be entrusted to women.

This Act (SITA, 1956) was later amended and renamed as the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (ITPA) in 1986, which remains in force today. The details above explain the original framework from which the ITPA evolved.

      PROGRAMMES & SCHEMES
      
   1.	Ujjwala Scheme
Ujjawala Scheme
(Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, launched in 2007)
The Ujjawala Scheme is a comprehensive initiative by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) aimed at preventing trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation and ensuring their rescue, rehabilitation, and reintegration into society.
• The scheme adopts a five-component approach:
•	Prevention – through community vigilance, awareness generation, and social mobilisation in vulnerable areas to reduce trafficking risks.
•	Rescue – by working with law enforcement agencies to identify and rescue victims from exploitative conditions.
•	Rehabilitation – by providing safe housing, medical care, counselling, legal aid, and vocational training through shelter homes and protective services.
•	Reintegration – through family reunification or placement in alternative care systems, ensuring survivors regain dignity and stability.
•	Repatriation – of cross-border victims in coordination with appropriate authorities.
• The scheme is centrally sponsored, with 100% funding from the Government of India for project setup costs and 75:25 (Centre:State) cost sharing for recurring expenses (90:10 for North-Eastern States).
• Implementation is carried out through State Governments, Union Territories, and recognised NGOs that operate Ujjawala Homes and rehabilitation centres under MWCD supervision.
• Beneficiaries receive comprehensive support, including medical and psychological care, legal assistance, education, skill training, and employment linkages to facilitate independent living.
• The scheme operates in close coordination with other MWCD initiatives such as Swadhar Greh, One Stop Centres, and the 181 Women Helpline to provide integrated services for women in distress.
• Periodic monitoring and evaluation is conducted through State Governments and independent agencies to ensure transparency, effectiveness, and survivor welfare.
• The Ujjawala Scheme aligns with India’s commitments under international conventions like the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.

2.	Mahila Police Volunteers (MPV) Scheme

Launched jointly by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the MPV Scheme aims to link police forces with local communities via trained female volunteers who assist women in distress and help promote gender-sensitive policing. The initiative began on a pilot basis in two districts in Haryana (Karnal and Mahendragarh) during the 2016-17 fiscal year under the “Nirbhaya Fund”. 
Key features and responsibilities of the scheme include:
•	Selecting socially aware women volunteers (typically age 21 or above, with at least higher secondary education) from local areas to serve as interfaces between the community and the police. 
•	Mobilising community participation, generating awareness about services available to women and children, and reporting incidents of violence, trafficking, child marriage, dowry harassment or missing children to the police. 
•	Forming local-level women-and-child protection groups such as “Mahila and Shishu Rakshak Dals” (MASRDs) and integrating existing community groups into those structures. 
•	Operating as a central sector scheme funded under the Nirbhaya Fund, with implementation by State/UT Governments in collaboration with MWCD/MHA. 
Monitoring details: By mid-2019, the scheme had been approved for 13 States/UTs and operationalised in 7 of them (Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Mizoram, Tripura) with over 9,500 volunteers appointed.
