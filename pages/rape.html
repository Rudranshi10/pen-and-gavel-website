      PROGRAMMES & SCHEMES
      
   1.	One Stop Centres (OSC)

The One Stop Centre (OSC) scheme was launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) in 2015 under the Nirbhaya Fund. It is designed to provide integrated support and assistance to women affected by violence, whether that violence occurs in public or private spaces.
Each centre acts as a safe space where women in distress can receive medical help, legal aid, police assistance, counselling, and temporary shelter—all under one roof. The main goal is to ensure that survivors of violence are not left to navigate the system alone but instead receive compassionate and coordinated care.
These centres are usually located within or near district hospitals to make emergency services easily accessible. They function around the clock and are equipped to respond to both immediate crises and ongoing support needs.
The OSC model follows a survivor-centric approach that prioritises a woman’s safety, dignity, and privacy. Every survivor is treated with empathy and respect, and no woman is denied help because she lacks identification or hesitates to share personal details. Confidentiality is always maintained unless disclosure is required by law.
Each centre works in close coordination with other mechanisms such as the Women Helpline (181), Anti-Human Trafficking Units, Legal Services Authorities, and Fast Track Courts. This ensures that survivors have access many services like filing a case, receiving medical care and getting long-term counselling and rehabilitation.
The centres also provide temporary accommodation for women and their children for up to five days or more, according to circumstances. This safe space allows survivors time to recover emotionally and make informed decisions about their next steps.
The OSCs are managed through a three-tier system. At the national level, the MWCD oversees policy and funding. At the state level, the Department of Women and Child Development is responsible for implementation. At the district level, the centres are supervised by the District Magistrate and a Management Committee made up of police, legal, health, and civil society representatives.
Each centre is run primarily by women professionals, including a Centre Administrator, case workers, counsellors, legal and medical officers, IT staff, and security personnel. These staff members receive specialised training from SPNIWCD in areas such as survivor care, trauma counselling, and crisis management.
The Ministry also conducts regular monitoring and evaluations of each centre. Survivor feedback, field inspections, and data reporting through the Mission Shakti Dashboard help ensure that services remain accountable, effective, and sensitive.
Today, more than 700 One Stop Centres operate across India, offering women a lifeline of support and a path to recovery. The OSC scheme is a key part of India’s broader mission to create a nation where every woman can live with safety, dignity, and equal opportunity — truly reflecting the spirit of “Nari Shakti” and advancing Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment.


2.	Swadhar Greh Scheme

The Swadhar Greh Scheme was introduced by the Government of India in 2015 under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD). It aims to provide integrated shelter and support services to women in distress who have been left without social or economic security.
•	The scheme seeks to ensure dignity, care, and rehabilitation for women facing difficult circumstances such as domestic violence, human trafficking, sexual assault, desertion, natural disasters, or social exclusion.
•	It merges two earlier programmes — Swadhar (2001) and Short Stay Homes — to create a unified framework for women’s welfare and recovery.
•	Each Swadhar Greh serves as a safe and supportive environment where women can live temporarily while rebuilding their lives.
•	Facilities include shelter, food, clothing, counselling, medical care, legal aid, and vocational training to enable economic independence and reintegration into society.
•	The scheme priorities rehabilitation and empowerment, encouraging women to regain self-confidence and self-reliance rather than long-term institutionalisation.
•	It is implemented through State Governments, Union Territories, and recognised NGOs, with financial assistance provided by the Central Government.
•	Preference is given to women victims of violence, trafficked women rescued from exploitative conditions, widows, and women released from prisons who lack family support.
•	Each home can accommodate up to 30 women, with flexibility based on regional needs.
•	The scheme also allows children accompanying the women (usually up to 18 years of age) to stay with them and access basic education and care.


3.	Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/ Survivors of Sexual Assault/ Other Crimes (2018, NLSA)

The scheme was formulated by NALSA (National Legal Services Authority) in consultation with the Ministry of Women and Child Development under Section 357A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
It aims to provide financial relief and rehabilitation to women who are victims of rape, sexual assault, acid attacks, or other crimes leading to physical or mental suffering.
States and Union Territories are required to adopt this as a model scheme or modify their existing victim compensation schemes to ensure uniformity across India.
Compensation is to be provided irrespective of the criminal proceedings — meaning even if the accused is not identified or convicted, victims remain eligible.
The scheme ensures interim compensation is provided to victims within 60 days of application to meet immediate needs such as medical treatment, shelter, and rehabilitation.
Minimum and maximum compensation amounts are prescribed depending on the nature of the offence:
Rape and unnatural sexual assault: ₹4–7 lakh
Acid attack (disfigurement beyond recognition): up to ₹8 lakh
Loss of foetus or infertility due to assault: up to ₹2 lakh
Physical abuse of minor girls: ₹2–5 lakh
The District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) or State Legal Services Authority (SLSA) is responsible for processing and disbursing compensation applications.
Victims may also be referred to medical, psychological, and legal counselling services through the legal aid network.
Funds are provided by the State Governments, often supplemented by the Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF).
